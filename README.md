### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to build a model to predict wine quality based on physicochemical
data. The analysis includes two datasets related to red and white variants of Portuguese "Vinho
Verde" wine. These datasets contain 1599 instances for red wine and 4898 instances for white
wine with 11 features of physicochemical data such as density, chlorides, total sulfur dioxide,
free sulphur dioxide, residual sugar, alcohol and pH. In this project, PySpark was used for data
cleaning, analysis and building predictive models. In order to run grid search for parameters
tuning local installation of Spark on Ubuntu was used.
